# lxqt-1.1-debian

This repo contains .deb packages of LXQt 1.1 that are tested with Debian unstable/testing/bullseye and Ubuntu 22.04.
It is structured in three main folders: 
- **lxqt** (this is the one you probably want as a normal user)
- **lxqt-dev** (this one contains the development versions of the packages; unless you need them to build lxqt from source you don't need them)
- **lxqt-dbgsym** (this one contains the debugging packages. Unless you really need them, you *shouldn't* have to install them.)

# Reporting bugs

All bugs related to packaging can be reported here. Before starting a new issue, make sure that it is in fact a packaging bug and not an upstream one.
